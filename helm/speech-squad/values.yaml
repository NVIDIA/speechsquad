# Ingress and LB need to be already installed and setup - this section just configures.

# If your installation will expose the service outside of the kubernetes cluster
# you will need to decide how to expose the service. If you use Loadbalancer and
# are not in a cloud service provider your cluster needs some way of connecting a
# service to an IP.
# If you dont want to use a loadbalancer make sure to edit the service type above.
